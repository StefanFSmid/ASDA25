### Dataset 1: "GEOFON Earthquake Data"
#### Why?
There are several research institutes worldwide that provide you with real-time EQ data. This is the German one. During an internship in 2019, it was at the GeoForschungsZentrum that I created my first map by digital means using this very data as a base. Thus, it sparked my interest in geodata.

### Dataset 1: "Open Food Facts"
#### Why?
Dietary shifts (e.g., veganism) can be tough, so how to facilitate it using ML tools? Together with a colleague, I had my first Deep Learning project work experience within the broader setting of TechLabs Hamburg using the data that can be obtained from this page.

### Dataset 1: Let's call it _Geodata wonderland_ a.k.a. "overpass turbo" :)
#### Why?
First things first: I know you asked for a concrete dataset and here's yet another API. But anyhow, at the moment, I am working with a lot of open geodata and for this reason this tool to get some neat OpenStreetMap data should not be missing on the list. It is what you ask for, and what can be asked is listed on the ever growing [OSM wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page).
